Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman the RSA encryption is a type of asymmetric encryption which has its whole focus on the modular exponentiation, therefore utilizing the big integer factorization as the security measure. The encryption algorithm consists on having two big prime numbers in a previously set modular group as private and public keys. These have to follow a specific array of rules for being able to be used as such, which can then be treated as the power of the clear text, in order to achieve the cipher text. Both encryption and decryption work similarly, but it has to be considered that the former uses the public, whereas the latter the private key." wrapText="true" />
